# Hiver's TF2 Maps
This is a git of all my Team Fortress 2 maps that I have created. I have actually
made it very simple for you, all you need to do is put the folder into your main
Team Fortress 2 directory. If you don't know how to get into your main game dir
just go on Steam and right the game and go to Manage then Browse Local Files.
So (Team Fortress 2 --> Manage --> Browse Local Files) or you can in Proporites.

# Maps
There are no finished maps but one at the moment is their to be downloaded


# Maps in progress
- ctf_botgrinderwiththeboys
- ctf_aqua

# ctf_botgrinderwiththeboys (Capture the Flag)
This map is designed for getting achievements or just to kill bots. The bots
are in a hole on the RED team and you are supposed to be BLU team killing them.
This map was built mostly by me and my friend Teko. This map doesn't feature
any custom assets, and isn't finished either but is almost complete.

# ctf_aqua (Capture the Flag)
This map is designed to be a part of a game called "Changed" where RED is at the
start of game and BLU in the aquarium part from the Original game. This map
does feature custom assets of course because who in their right mind would
make it with tf2 textures. This map is no where near finished, and prob wont
for a good while.
