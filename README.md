# Hiver's TF2 Maps
This is a git of all my Team Fortress 2 maps that I have created. the maps will
have a .bsp that you put into tf/maps. But if there is a .vpk put it in tf/custom.
The vpk is a Valve Pak with custom textures or custom models.

# ctf_botgrinderwiththeboys (Capture the Flag)
This map is designed for getting achievements or just to kill bots. The bots
are in a hole on the RED team and you are supposed to be BLU team killing them.
This map was built mostly by me and my friend Teko. This map doesn't feature
any custom assets, and isn't finished either but is almost complete.
